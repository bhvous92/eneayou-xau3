        </div>
        <div class="text1 appear">
            <p>People in this triad perceive life as a struggle to be won in their attempt to accomplish something.
                Doing this tends to hold their ground rather than adapt to the situation. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text2 appear">
            <p>They process their world not primarily by thinking or feeling but by responding from a place deep within.
                They tend to pay attention to their intuitive grasp of people, circumstances, and relational dynamics.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text3 appear">
            <p>When healthy, those within this triad are not easily swayed by the opinions of others or what is
                happening in their present circumstances. They are relaxed and open and respond deeply and totally to
                the present moment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text4 appear">
            <h3>Those in this Gut Triad want to:</h3>
            <p>- Freely pursue their wants and needs</p>
            <p>- Assure their well-being</p>
            <p>- Remain grounded in their ability to decide for themselves</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text5 appear">
            <h1>Enneagram Eights <span>– Express Their Anger Outwardly</span></h1>
            <p>When Eights feel anger building in them, they immediately respond to it in some physical way, raising
                their voices and moving more forcefully. Others can clearly see that Eights are angry because they give
                themselves permission to express their anger physically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text6 appear">
            <h1>Enneagram Nines <span>– Feel Threatened By Their Anger</span></h1>
            <p>Nines deny their anger and instinctual energies as if to say, “What anger? I am not a person who gets
                angry.” Nines are the type most out of touch with their anger and instinctual energies, often feeling
                threatened by them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text7 appear">
            <h1>Enneagram Ones <span>– Repress And Try To Control Their Anger</span></h1>
            <p>Ones feel they must stay in control of themselves at all times, especially of instinctual impulses and
                angry feelings.</p>
