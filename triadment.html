            <h1>TRÍADE MENTAL</h1>
            <p>(tipos 05, 06 e 07)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text1 appear">
            <p>The way this triad perceives life in terms of finding a safe place and a safe way forward. They process
                what they have observed primarily through their heads, and reality can become what they construct within
                their thoughts more than what is happening.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text2 appear">
            <p>Those in this triad live most from their true self when they have substantive clarity about life and
                grasp reality comprehensively and perceptively.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text3 appear">
            <p>They are steady and stable in their life and are easily trusted. They are skilled at taking in
                information, ordering it, strategizing, and anticipating possibilities and consequences.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text4 appear">
            <h3>Those in this Head Triad want to:</h3>
            <p>- Minimize anxiety</p>
            <p>- Obtain certainty and security</p>
            <p>- Gain knowledge</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text5 appear">
            <h1>Enneagram Fives <span>– Express Their Anger Outwardly</span></h1>
            <p>Fives fear the outer world and their capacity to cope with it. Thus, they cope with their fear by
                withdrawing from the world. Fives become secretive, isolated loners who use their minds to penetrate the
                nature of the world. Fives hope that eventually, as they understand reality on their own terms, they
                will be able to rejoin the world and participate in it, but they never feel they know enough to
                participate with total confidence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text6 appear">
            <h1>Enneagram Sixes <span>– Feel Threatened By Their Anger</span></h1>
            <p>Sixes exhibit the most fear of all three of the Head Triad types. This is largely experienced as anxiety,
                which causes them to be the most out of touch with their own sense of inner knowing and confidence.
                Sixes have trouble trusting their minds, so they constantly look outside themselves for something to
                make them feel sure of themselves. They might turn to philosophies, beliefs, relationships, jobs,
                savings, authorities, or any combination above.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text7 appear">
            <h1>Enneagram Sevens <span>– Repress And Try To Control Their Anger</span></h1>
            <p>Sevens fear their inner world. Their feelings of pain, loss, deprivation, and general anxiety that Sevens
                would like to stay clear of as much as possible. To cope with these feelings, Sevens keep their minds
                occupied with exciting possibilities and options – as long as they have something stimulating to
                anticipate, Sevens feel that they can distract themselves from their fears.</p>
