            <h1>TRÍADE EMOCIONAL</h1>
            <p>(tipos 02, 03 e 04)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text1 appear">
            <p>People in this triad perceive the world in terms of connections to be made. Life is a social network to
                enter and engage in. They process relational reality primarily through and with their feelings. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text2 appear">
            <p>When those within this triad live from their essence, they live from a place of authenticity, truth,
                self-giving compassion, and forgiveness—all of which emerge from deep inner-directedness.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text3 appear">
            <p>When healthy, those within this triad are not easily swayed by the opinions of others or what is
                happening in their present circumstances. They are relaxed and open and respond deeply and totally to
                the present moment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text4 appear">
            <h3>Those in this Heart Triad want to:</h3>
            <p>- Establish connection with others by meeting their needs</p>
            <p>- Receive recognition</p>
            <p>- Feel understood by others</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text5 appear">
            <h1>Enneagram Twos <span>– Attempt To Control Their Shame</span></h1>
            <p>Twos want to convince themselves that they are good, loving people by focusing on their positive feelings
                for others while repressing their negative feelings (such as anger and resentment at not being
                appreciated enough). They attempt to control shame by getting people to like them and think of them as
                good people.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text6 appear">
            <h1>Enneagram Threes <span>– Deny Their Shame</span></h1>
            <p>Threes are potentially the most out of touch with underlying feelings of inadequacy. Threes learn to cope
                with shame by trying to become what they believe a valuable, successful person is like. Thus, Threes
                learn to perform well, to be acceptable, even outstanding and are often driven relentlessly in their
                pursuit of success to stave off feelings of shame and fear of failure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text7 appear">
            <h1>Enneagram Fours <span>– Try To Control Their Shame</span></h1>
            <p>Fours attempt to control their shame by focusing on how unique and special their particular talents,
                feelings, and personal characteristics are. Fours highlight their individuality and creativity as a way
                of dealing with their shameful feelings, although Fours are the type most likely to succumb to feelings
                of inadequacy.</p>
